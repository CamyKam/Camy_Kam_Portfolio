### Power BI Dashboards
#### Contractor Expense Tracking
The 2 images below show a dashboard that tracks the expenses of current contractors working for a company and how many days they've worked in the current fiscal year. 
The dashboard also tracks how much budget is remaining, the calculated burnrate, and which contracs will be expiring soon based on DAX queries and budget info (not displayed in the image)

#### Ottawa Public Library Holds (2022)
This Power BI dashboard shows several reports with information about the most popular library titles based on holds placed. The lists show us what the top 10 most popular English and French titles were, while the graphs breakdown the number of holds based on language, format, and genre. Clicking on specific sections of the graphs would cross filter the tables, so you can see the 10 top titles for English Nonfiction for example:

## Tableau Dashboards
#### Bike Thefts in Ottawa
After observing data on bike thefts in Ottawa, it is clear that Centretown and Sandy Hill are the neighbourhoods that have experienced the most bike thefts from 2017-2022. Also interesting to see that most bike thefts occur on a Monday with less thefts over the weekend.
Data was obtained from the Open Ottawa site.
